# Abstract: Continuous Dependency Updating (CDU) - A Modern DevOps Practice

Continuous Dependency Updating (CDU) is an emerging DevOps practice that aims to streamline and automate the process of keeping software dependencies up-to-date. By integrating CDU with established Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices, software development teams can improve the security, performance, compatibility, and maintainability of their applications. This paper provides an in-depth examination of CDU, covering its implementation using package managers and CI/CD tools, versioning strategies for dependencies, and considerations such as testing, code modifications, monitoring, and alerting. The paper also discusses the benefits and potential drawbacks of adopting CDU and addresses the legal, security, and human resources aspects of implementing this practice. By evaluating the pros and cons of CDU and following the best practices outlined in this paper, software development teams can make informed decisions about adopting CDU and integrating it into their workflows.
