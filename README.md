This repository introduces the concept of Continuous Dependency Updating (CDU), a modern software development practice that aims to keep dependencies up-to-date, ensuring that applications benefit from the latest security patches, vulnerability fixes, performance improvements, and compatibility enhancements.

For an in-depth analysis of Continuous Dependency Updating, please refer to the following technical paper:

**[CDU: A Modern DevOps Practice](cdu-a-modern-devops-practice.pdf)**

This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the benefits, drawbacks, and implementation strategies of CDU, as well as discussing the legal, security, and human resources aspects associated with adopting this practice.

## Introduction

Continuous Dependency Updating (CDU) is a novel CI/CD practice that helps software development teams to frequently update their project dependencies to the latest versions using automated scripts or tools. With CDU, you can ensure your codebase stays compatible with the most recent changes in these dependencies, reducing the risk of potential security vulnerabilities, and taking advantage of new features and improvements.

## Getting Started

To get started with CDU, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Familiarize yourself with your project's dependency management system (e.g., `pip`, `npm`, `Maven`, `Gradle`, etc.).
2. Identify the dependencies you want to update continuously.
3. Create an automated script or tool to handle dependency updates (consider using existing tools for your dependency management system).
4. Configure your CI/CD pipeline to run the script/tool at regular intervals or on specific events.

## Integration with CI CD Tools

CDU can be integrated into your project using modern CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and others. These tools help automate the process of updating dependencies and running tests to ensure that everything still works as expected after updating. Check our [examples](#examples) for sample configurations for popular CI/CD tools.

## Handling Breaking Changes with AI

One challenge with CDU is the risk of breaking changes being introduced by updated dependencies. To tackle this issue, AI can be used to identify and fix any breaking changes that occur during the update process. By incorporating AI-powered tools into the CI/CD pipeline, development teams can automate the process of identifying and addressing compatibility issues, making CDU a more reliable and efficient approach.

## Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples showing how to implement CDU for various programming languages, dependency management systems, and CI/CD tools. Check the `examples` directory for sample configurations and scripts.

- [C#](./examples/csharp.yml) - CDU implementation for a C# project using .NET Core and NuGet for dependency management.
- [C++](./examples/cpp.yml) - CDU implementation for a C++ project using Conan as a package manager.
- [Deno](./examples/deno.yml) - CDU implementation for a Deno project using the deps.ts file for dependency management.
- [Java](./examples/java.yml) - CDU implementation for a Java project using Maven for dependency management.
- [NodeJS](./examples/nodejs.yml) - CDU implementation for a Node.js project using npm for dependency management.
- [PHP](./examples/php.yml) - CDU implementation for a PHP project using Composer for dependency management.
- [Python](./examples/python.yml) - CDU implementation for a Python project using pip for dependency management.
- [Ruby](./examples/ruby.yml) - CDU implementation for a Ruby project using Bundler for dependency management.
- [Bash](./examples/bash.yml) - CDU implementation for a Unix-like system using apt as the package manager.
- [Typescript](./examples/typescript.yml) - CDU implementation for a TypeScript project using npm for dependency management.

## Best Practices

Before implementing CDU in your project, consider the following best practices:

- Always have a robust testing suite to catch potential issues introduced by dependency updates.
- Set up notifications for your team to review the results of dependency updates and tests.
- Monitor and track dependency updates to understand the impact of changes on your project.
- Maintain a rollback strategy in case an update introduces critical issues.
